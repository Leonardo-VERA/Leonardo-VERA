### 🚀 What I Do

I help teams unlock the value of their data by building scalable pipelines, automating workflows, and delivering meaningful dashboards.

I’m particularly interested in:
- ⚙️ **ETL / ELT & Data Pipelines** (Python, PySpark, Airflow, Databricks)  
- ☁️ **Cloud & Big Data Architectures** (BigQuery, GCP, SQL, NoSQL)  
- ⚙️ **Automation of workflows and reporting** of repetitive tasks  
- 🔁 **Digital transformation** through Python scripting & low-code tools  
- 🧠 **Data-driven decision-making** in operational and business contexts  
- 💬 **Clear communication** between technical and non-technical teams

### ⚡ Projects I'm proud of

- 🎼 **Deep Learning project - Music Score to Audio**  
  A project that generates audio played music from music score sheets. Using computer vision and music generation models, this tool analyzes visual elements like notes, dynamics and tempo to recreate an audio piece of a given score.  
  → Check the repo [`Music Score to Audio`](https://github.com/Leonardo-VERA/PicToMusic) and try the app [`Streamlit app`](https://sonatabene.streamlit.app/)  
  
- ♟️ **Queens solver game algorithm using streamlitapp**  
  A logic puzzle solver and visualizer for a variation of the classic N-Queens problem.
  The app allows users to explore solutions interactively through a clean interface built with Streamlit.  
  → Check the repo: [`Queens Solver app`](https://github.com/Leonardo-VERA/queens_solver) andt try the app [`Streamlit app`](https://queenapplver-qcv9joqm8fmfroiuxaschj.streamlit.app/)  

- 🧪 **Gold Price Predictor – Machine Learning Project**  
  A predictive model for forecasting gold prices using machine learning and time series analysis.
  The project explores multiple approaches and includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and evaluation metrics.  
  → Check the repo: [`Gold Model Predictor`](https://github.com/Leonardo-VERA/M1_projet_etude)  


- 📅 **Web Memory Toolkit – Intelligent Web Extraction & Summarization**
  A modular tool that allows you to extract, summarize, and organize valuable content from any public webpage using Python and OpenAI.  
  Designed for journalists, analysts, researchers, or anyone who wants to build structured knowledge from online sources.  
  Instead of just saving bookmarks, you define your intention: keep a table, analyze text, download images, or generate a summary. The tool does the rest—scraping, formatting, and saving locally.  
  → 👍 Built with: `Python` + `BeautifulSoup` + `API OpenAI` + `Google Colab`  
  → Future-ready for cloud deployment via Google Cloud Functions 🦾🛠️  
  → Check the repo: [`Web Memory Toolkit`](https://github.com/Leonardo-VERA/web-memory-toolkit)
